# Trivia Game

This project consists of creating a Trivia game using React and consuming information from the Trivia API.

Since the beginning of the project, we have always maintained a lot of respect and collaboration between all the people who are part of the team. It was also a huge organizational and communication challenge to keep all people aligned with the progress of the project.

So we use some agile methodologies such as Kanban and Scrum to keep the project progress more efficient and transparent. The experience was excellent and we learned a lot from it.

In the application, we use ReactJS, ContextAPI for managing global states, Bootstrap for styling.
